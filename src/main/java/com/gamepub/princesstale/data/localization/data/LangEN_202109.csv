dialog_dungeon_01_start_01,Is this place really the underground of the abbey?
dialog_dungeon_01_start_02,"I didn’t know a place like this existed, either…"
dialog_dungeon_01_start_03,But this dark place relaxes me for some reason.
dialog_dungeon_01_start_04,Let’s check what’s in here.
dialog_dungeon_01_reward_01,I didn't even think we could get these loots.
dialog_dungeon_01_reward_02,Maybe the Goddess gifted these to us to aid us in defeating the Demon King.
dialog_dungeon_01_reward_03,"Well… The more, the merrier, I guess…"
dialog_dungeon_01_end_01,I guess that’s the last of this place.
dialog_dungeon_01_end_02,The number of monsters here was surprising. They made me sweat a little.
dialog_dungeon_01_end_03,I didn't think such a dungeon was located below the abbey.
dialog_dungeon_01_end_04,That means there are other dungeons like this elsewhere.
dialog_dungeon_01_end_05,I hope all these things are the will of the Goddess…
dialog_dungeon_02_start_01,This is the place known as the Cursed Lighthouse of Molta!
dialog_dungeon_02_start_02,That’s just a countryside rumor…
dialog_dungeon_02_start_03,Let’s get in and find out if the rumor is true or not!
dialog_dungeon_02_start_04,"Come on, let’s go!!"
dialog_dungeon_02_start_05,"W, wait… Slow down…"
dialog_dungeon_02_reward_01,There are always cursed treasures near the sea…
dialog_dungeon_02_reward_02,A curse? Is it real?
dialog_dungeon_02_reward_03,Just kidding! I don't see anything like that.
dialog_dungeon_02_reward_04,That’s a relief.
dialog_dungeon_02_end_01,I guess the rumor of curse was false.
dialog_dungeon_02_end_02,Maybe someone living in this dull countryside got bored and created that strange rumor…
dialog_dungeon_02_end_03,But I had fun here!
dialog_dungeon_02_end_04,If you say so…
dialog_dungeon_02_end_05,Let’s search for another place like this someday!
dialog_dungeon_03_start_01,So this is the rumored mercenary HQ…
dialog_dungeon_03_start_02,Hmm… Doesn't really look like an HQ.
dialog_dungeon_03_start_03,It’s a secret after all. Turn back if you don’t want to come along.
dialog_dungeon_03_start_04,No. I have a feeling that I’ll be able to find some good drink in this place!
dialog_dungeon_03_start_05,Tsk… I wanted to have all the treasures to myself…
dialog_dungeon_03_reward_01,Hmm… Is there no alcohol in this place…?
dialog_dungeon_03_reward_02,Wait! Don't mess around! That’s my share!
dialog_dungeon_03_reward_03,Don't worry. I won't take anything other than alcohol!
dialog_dungeon_03_reward_04,Hey! What are you stuffing in your bag?!
dialog_dungeon_03_end_01,"Hmph, just a bunch of weaklings."
dialog_dungeon_03_end_02,But it was quite tough.
dialog_dungeon_03_end_03,You didn’t do much.
dialog_dungeon_03_end_04,But I got a pretty good alcohol!
dialog_dungeon_03_end_05,Tsk…
dialog_dungeon_03_end_06,Oh! Wait for me!
dialog_dungeon_04_start_01,I didn't think the bottom of the lake would be like this…
dialog_dungeon_04_start_02,"I heard that the kingdom sinking. It would reach this place soon, I guess?"
dialog_dungeon_04_start_03,Please don’t say something like that…
dialog_dungeon_04_start_04,"Anyway, let's look around for some useful ingredients for new potions!"
dialog_dungeon_04_reward_01,It feels damp here. Maybe because we’re at the bottom of a lake.
dialog_dungeon_04_reward_02,I’m not sure about that. This place is protected with magic…
dialog_dungeon_04_reward_03,But there are quite a few interesting things here that I can use as ingredients!
dialog_dungeon_04_reward_04,"Umm, you should be moderate in gathering…"
dialog_dungeon_04_end_01,I think the problem in this place is settled now… Thank you for your help.
dialog_dungeon_04_end_02,"I didn't do much, though!"
dialog_dungeon_04_end_03,"And the kingdom is still sinking, remember?"
dialog_dungeon_04_end_04,We need more help from other people…
dialog_dungeon_04_end_05,"Don’t worry too much. Everything has a side effect, you know!"
dialog_dungeon_04_end_06,Please stop saying things like that…
dialog_dungeon_05_start_01,I didn't know a place like this existed under the windmill.
dialog_dungeon_05_start_02,Maybe I can gather some useful ingredients here!
dialog_dungeon_05_start_03,Will I be able to make a new dessert with them?
dialog_dungeon_05_start_04,Maybe I can cook up an amazing dish! Let’s go!
dialog_dungeon_05_reward_01,I don't see any cooking ingredient… Only treasures…
dialog_dungeon_05_reward_02,It’s time for a dessert!
dialog_dungeon_05_reward_03,"But first, a cuisine!!"
dialog_dungeon_05_reward_04,It’s always welcome to eat sweet things♪
dialog_dungeon_05_end_01,"No matter how hard I search, I can't find a single new cooking ingredient…"
dialog_dungeon_05_end_02,Maybe it’s because big sister has tried every ingredient in our kingdom…?
dialog_dungeon_05_end_03,"No, that’s not… Oh! Look at the time! It’s time to start preparing a meal! And desserts!"
dialog_dungeon_05_end_04,Desserts must not be forgotten!
dialog_dungeon_05_end_05,Let's go now before I get late!
dialog_dungeon_06_start_01,My clothes will be ruined if I stay at a dirty place like this!
dialog_dungeon_06_start_02,But I heard that there is important information here.
dialog_dungeon_06_start_03,Are you really sure about that important information?
dialog_dungeon_06_start_04,"…We’ll see. Come on, let’s go!"
dialog_dungeon_06_reward_01,"Hmm. Well, we’ve got some good enough things, although the shapes are a bit unsatisfactory."
dialog_dungeon_06_reward_02,"These are very useful in battles, you know?"
dialog_dungeon_06_reward_03,Design is more important than performance!
dialog_dungeon_06_end_01,My designer clothes are getting covered with dust…
dialog_dungeon_06_end_02,I think we’ve checked pretty much everywhere around here.
dialog_dungeon_06_end_03,No useful information… I don’t think there’s anything else to do here.
dialog_dungeon_06_end_04,Then let’s get out of here! My precious designer items will be ruined if we stay here any longer!
dialog_dungeon_06_end_05,Slow down! You’ll get more dust if you run here!

rel_1_story,"<%enter%>An interview with the Royal University of Romanetia’s professor of history about the Draconians<%enter%><%enter%>The ancient Draconians, who are said to have existed since the birth of the world, are wrapped in many mysteries. There isn’t any history book describing where they came from or how long they live. However, as they stepped out into our world, a few interesting facts about them has become known.<%enter%><%enter%> First, although their lifespan is very long, it’s not infinite as Elves’. However, it is not known exactly how long it is.<%enter%><%enter%> Second, their memory is similar to an average human’s, so they begin to forget the things happened in the past as they get older and older.<%enter%><%enter%> Third, it is said that they have the ability to move to another dimension. Some say that if a Draconian does not show themselves for quite a while, they’re currently in another dimension.<%enter%><%enter%> Lastly, people say that there are only 4 last Draconians in this world right now: 1 man and 3 women. It is told that the rest of the Draconians died in wars or went to other dimensions and never came back.<%enter%><%enter%>It’s not easy to understand their way of thinking because it’s different from other ordinary races in this world, but one thing is clear: they are friendly and like to help us. It has been proven with their brave performance in the history of war against the Demon King.<%enter%><%enter%> One sad thing is that because of their memory I mentioned before, I hear “I don't remember it” too many times when I run across them and ask them something. We could learn many more things if only they remembered everything."

So she decided to recruit the crew to find the treasure with her.<%enter%><%enter%> A few days later, two girls came to Natalia. One was “Suyoung,” a Werefox who wishes to be a Human, and the other one was “Aria,” a young witch who loves marshmallows.<%enter%>The three got on Natalia’s small boat and began sailing towards the treasure island with anticipation.<%enter%><%enter%> However, the sea was not particularly kind to them. Wild wind and waves began to stir. After an arduous voyage, they managed to reach the treasure island, plowed through a dense forest, and defeated ferocious monsters. Finally, they found the wish-granting treasure at a hidden cave!<%enter%><%enter%>As the girls touched the lamp-shaped treasure with bated breath, a cute fairy emerged from the lamp and told them to state their wishes.<%enter%>The girls rolled a dice to decide who would go first, and the lucky first one was Aria.<%enter%>Delighted, Aria approached the fairy and stated her wish.<%enter%>”I want to have the biggest marshmallow in the world!”<%enter%><%enter%>After she said that, the fairy conjured a gigantic marshmallow. Then, she said this.<%enter%><%enter%>”I granted your wish, so I’ll be on my way now! Buh-bye!”<%enter%><%enter%>Suyoung, who was preparing to state her wish next, began to cry in massive disappointment. Nobody had thought that the fairy would grant only one wish.<%enter%>Natalia consoled the crying girl and told her.<%enter%><%enter%>”There must be another treasure that will grant your wish somewhere in the world! Don’t cry. I’ll find it for you!”<%enter%><%enter%>The sea on their way back was more peaceful than ever. The girls roasted Aria’s gigantic marshmallow and chattered all night.<%enter%><%enter%> As the morning came and the boat arrived at the port, the girls felt sorry that they had to say goodbye, but they exchanged farewells and made a promise to go on a voyage to hunt treasures again someday. And the three girls reassembled at an unexpected place.<%enter%><%enter%>Where is it?<%enter%><%enter%>The battlefield to defeat the Demon King!"

Not because you enjoy it more to live among Humans?”<%enter%><%enter%>”If you’ll keep being so sarcastic, why don't you just leave?”<%enter%><%enter%>Hearing the other woman’s annoyed retort, the woman with red hood turned her had and laughed. The bartender served the wine at that moment. She fiddled with the wine bottle and said with a sigh.<%enter%><%enter%>”My ppor sister… To think that you don't belong anywhere…”<%enter%><%enter%>The black haired woman snatched the bottle and poured the liquid into a clear glass before responding.<%enter%><%enter%>”I chose it. There is… no regret.”<%enter%><%enter%>Expressing that it was beyond her comprehension with a scowl, the red-hooded woman asked back.<%enter%><%enter%>”What’s so good about being a messed up Half-Vampire?”<%enter%><%enter%>The black haired woman slowly sipped the blood-like crimson wine and answered.<%enter%><%enter%>”That’s it. That half of me is Human. Same as my mother…”<%enter%><%enter%>The woman with red hood sat silently for a long while. As the woman with black hair finished her glass of wine, she stood from her chair and spoke.<%enter%><%enter%>”Well… You seem to be faring well, so I’ll tell father not to worry. See you at Transylvania…”<%enter%><%enter%>Without even looking at the other woman leaving, the black-haired woman refilled her glass with wine.

No, nya!!! If we miss this ship, the next one will come three months later, nya!”<%enter%><%enter%>Miko came to her senses again and said while shaking her head furiously. However, the next words from Sana shattered Miko’s determination.<%enter%><%enter%>”You will dream about takoyaki for the rest of your life back home if we go back without trying it, nya!”<%enter%><%enter%>Eventually, Miko decided to try takoyaki.<%enter%><%enter%>”…One quick bite wouldn’t hurt, nyaight?”<%enter%>""That’s my big sis, nya!

You’ve experienced it too, right?”<%enter%><%enter%>The magician was bewildered by the rabbit girl’s words.<%enter%><%enter%>”(This is just a headband…) Well… It’s actually…”<%enter%>""I know that they don’t do it on purpose, but our ears are not some kind of tourist attraction!”<%enter%><%enter%>Seeing that the rabbit girl wasn't going to stop soon, the magician decided to just listen to her ranting.<%enter%><%enter%>”…(You’re a friend who don’t listen to others…)”<%enter%>”If you’ve got some time, let's have carrot juice together!

You’re our first customer, so I can’t let you go with nothing. I made a glass of strawberry juice a moment ago, so try it before you leave. It’s free!”<%enter%><%enter%>The girl with glasses saw Crissy leaving and quickly offered the juice she just made.<%enter%><%enter%>The word “free” tempted Crissy and made her decide to try it.

And it feels cleaner than the juice sold at other places…”<%enter%>”That’s because it doesn’t contain real strawberries…”<%enter%>”Silence!!”<%enter%><%enter%>As the blue-eyed girl cut Crissy off, the glasses-wearing girl snapped at her and let Crissy continue.<%enter%>”And?”<%enter%><%enter%>”But, well… It tastes a bit bland for some reason…”<%enter%>”Real strawbe… Oop!”<%enter%><%enter%>As the blue-eyed girl tried to speak again, the glasses-wearing girl used her hand to cover the other girl’s mouth before speaking to Crissy.<%enter%><%enter%>”Haha! I see. Thank you for your valuable opinion, customer!”<%enter%>”Yes… I’ll be on my way, then… Thanks for the juice.”<%enter%><%enter%>Crissy said goodbye to them. She made a thought before stepping out of the shop.<%enter%><%enter%>’If they make the juice thicker, it wont't get bland even if they use ice flakes…’<%enter%><%enter%>Crissy spoke to the quarreling girls after a brief hesitation.<%enter%><%enter%>”Hey… Wouldn't it be OK to use ice flakes if you make the strawberry juice thicker? Like jam you spread on bread slices, or syrup…<%enter%>”Oh! That’s a good idea. I should test it right away!”<%enter%>Sugared iced water with thick strawberry flavor? That doesn't sound half bad.”<%enter%><%enter%>The girl with glasses ignored the blue girl and spoke to Crissy.<%enter%><%enter%>”I’ll let you drink it if you come tomorrow, so please come again!”<%enter%>”I will!”<%enter%><%enter%>Crissy answered merrily and left the shop with a good cheer.<%enter%>However, Crissy couldn’t go to the juice shop the next day because she had an upset stomach.

One day, I was coming back with the knights from a long and arduous expedition… and the prince had come out to meet me. Alone. Without even having any guards.”<%enter%><%enter%>Charlotte stood in front of the flowers Bianca had been looking at and continued.<%enter%><%enter%>”His clothes were ruined. It looked like he had tumbled to a mud pool. Even his face was full of stabs and scratches.”<%enter%><%enter%>Charlotte smiled, perhaps because she recalled the memory.<%enter%><%enter%>”I was taken aback, so I got off my horse and approached the prince. And… I saw that he was hiding something behind his back.”<%enter%><%enter%>She kneeled down and stroked the flowers with another smile.<%enter%><%enter%>”I was about to ask the prince what he was hiding, but he spoke first. ‘Happy birthday, Charlotte!’ That’s what he said…”<%enter%><%enter%>Charlotte plucked a flower and gave it to Bianca.<%enter%><%enter%>”He revealed a rose and said, ‘This is your favorite flower, right, Charlotte? The rose of Province!’”<%enter%><%enter%>As Bianca received the rose from Charlotte, she turned her eyes to the garden flowers again.<%enter%><%enter%>”Even I had forgotten about my own birthday in those brutal battles and arduous journeys… But the prince celebrated it for me. With a rose he had plucked himself…”<%enter%><%enter%>She looked at Bianca again with a happy look.<%enter%><%enter%>”How can I not like such a warm-hearted and lovely person? That day, I made a vow inwardly. I vowed that I would be with the prince and protect him for the rest of my life.”<%enter%><%enter%>After a brief silence, Bianca looked at the rose given by Charlotte and made a faint smile.<%enter%><%enter%>”I didn't know my little brother was such a kind one.

The castle is heavily guarded, so we decided to put 3 people, including you, for it.”<%enter%><%enter%>Upon hearing the secretary’s words, she asked with a grumble.<%enter%><%enter%>”Hmph… You’re making an arbitrary decision again. By the way, why did you include me in an assassination mission?”<%enter%>”It’s a long story, so shall we talk it over a cup of tea?”<%enter%><%enter%><%enter%> A few days later, early in the morning at Baron Alfred’s castle.<%enter%><%enter%>As the infiltration got delayed because the castle was tightly guarded, Camila, an assassin and another participant for the mission, grumbled.”<%enter%><%enter%>”What was the guild thinking? To put that heavy shield-wielding warrior in an assassination mission…”<%enter%><%enter%>Catalina, another assassin participant, scolded her to keep her voice down.<%enter%><%enter%>”Be quiet.

You didn’t even go through preliminary research? From what I gathered, Baron Alfred is rumored to have conspired with heathens. People say that he is kidnapping children at southern Vegas and producing drugs.”<%enter%><%enter%>Camila asked back as if she couldn't believe what she heard.<%enter%><%enter%>”Heathens? You mean Demon King worshippers? And what’s up with the children?”<%enter%><%enter%>Matilda answered like she’s a veteran in the field.<%enter%><%enter%>”To use them in producing drugs. Children are easy to handle. Now I see why the guild boys forced me into this mission.”<%enter%><%enter%>”What’s that supposed to…?!”<%enter%><%enter%>As Camila was about to ask what she had meant by that, Baron Alfred emerged from the darkness.<%enter%><%enter%>”I suspected the Black Market had gotten wind of me… As I expected, shall I say? Assassins who chatter so loudly… Bahahahaha! You will all die here, brats!”<%enter%><%enter%>As the baron finished his words and disappeared into the darkness, a number of shadows emerged from everywhere and attacked them. <%enter%><%enter%>”These guys are fast! Ugh! I won’t let you win like this!”<%enter%><%enter%>Camila was surprised by the enemies’ speed, but she quickly countered and put her dagger into an enemy’s solar plexus.<%enter%>But the enemy didn’t cease to attack her.<%enter%><%enter%>”What!? But I stabbed a vital point!”<%enter%><%enter%>Matilda calmed her down.<%enter%><%enter%>”Be careful. They are Hashashins. Assassins who are high on drugs. You must kill them with one strike to stop them going at you.”<%enter%><%enter%>Catalina grumbled after hearing her words.<%enter%><%enter%>”Tsk! Easier said than done. It’s only going to be a fight of attrition at this rate.”<%enter%><%enter%>As the number of Hashashins never went down even though they kept fighting them off, Matilda made a decision and spoke to the other women.<%enter%><%enter%>”I’ll take these guys, so you go take care of the baron. Time is short. The guards will come soon too.”<%enter%><%enter%>Catalina thought that it was absurd, but Matilda was resolute in her opinion.<%enter%><%enter%>”You’re going to take all of them by yourself? Don't be ridiculous!”<%enter%>”I’ve faced countless of these drug-high tramps back in my homeland. This is the reason why I came here today.”<%enter%><%enter%>Catalina couldn't help but accept Matilda’s persistence.<%enter%><%enter%>”It can't be helped. This was supposed to be a covert assassination, but it’s all messed up now.”<%enter%><%enter%>As Catalina dived into the darkness in search of the baron, Camila spoke up before following her.<%enter%><%enter%>”It’s an assassination if there is no witness, fool!

Blood gushed out from the wound, and the bear howled in pain.<%enter%><%enter%>”Craaawr!!”<%enter%>”Now!”<%enter%><%enter%>Allain shouted, and Hilde summoned big, beautiful flower next to the bear.

Luraine could easily see that the voice was coming from the black apple in front of her. She was dubious about the suspicious gemstone, but driven by her desire to get away from the kingdom, she asked the black apple with a trembling voice.<%enter%><%enter%>”Can you really get me out of this hell?”<%enter%><%enter%>As soon as Luraine asked that question, she heard the sound of someone running from behind her, followed by panicked yelling.<%enter%><%enter%>”Luraine!

Black smoke engulfed Luraine, and her fair skin got darker and darker.<%enter%><%enter%>”Now you are free from the chains of light. Let us go now, to the place where our sisters awaits.”<%enter%><%enter%>At those words, a dark dimensional gate opened. The soul whispered into Lucien’s head.<%enter%><%enter%>”It seems your foolish jealousy has freed your sister.

Looking at her, Luraine bid farewell.<%enter%><%enter%>”Goodbye… Lucien…”<%enter%><%enter%>With that, Luraine got engulfed by the soul of the black apple and dragged into the dimensional gate. Then, the dimensional gate vanished away in a blink.<%enter%><%enter%>”Luraine…”<%enter%><%enter%>Lucien called her little sister's name in the pitch-dark underground storage, but the only answer she received was the hollow echo of her own voice."
rel_18_story,"<%enter%>A port on the outskirts of Talia…<%enter%> <%enter%>Yumi opened a small takoyaki store in front of the port in the hope of learning about the lives of the land people. She looked at Thulhu, a magical robot, and asked something. Perhaps she doesn't like her job.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Thulhu, can this really help me?”<%enter%>”Of course. To experience the life of the land people, nothing is better than selling food.”<%enter%> <%enter%>Thulhu answered with conviction. Yumi sighed and started to pour takoyaki dough onto the iron grill.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Ohhhh, I haven’t seen this store before. What are you selling?”<%enter%> <%enter%>That moment, Hari, a Werebear girl, approached with curious eyes and asked. Yumi dryly answered the question she answered countless times today.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Takoyaki.”<%enter%>”Takoyaki? It’s the first time I’ve heard about it.”<%enter%>”Cat customers love it. Maybe you, too?”<%enter%> <%enter%>As Yumi compared her to Werecat customers who had visited yesterday, Hari grumbled to express that her pride got hurt by the remark.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Don't compare me to those cats! I’ve got more refined taste than them, you know!”<%enter%> <%enter%>As the baked takoyaki dough started to emit a pleasant scent, “Illiana,” who was passing nearby, smelled it and approached Yumi to ask a question.<%enter%> <%enter%>”This smell. What are you cooking?”<%enter%>”Takoyaki.”<%enter%>”What goes in it?”<%enter%>”Octopus.”<%enter%>”Octopus? Is that a vegetable?”<%enter%> <%enter%>Hearing Illiana ask what octopus was, Yumi looked at Thulhu and spoke.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Thulhu. Show her how an octopus looks.”<%enter%> <%enter%>Hearing Yumi’s order, Thulhu projected a moving shape of light from its big eyes for Illiana. The shape depicted an octopus actively wriggling and swimming in the sea. <%enter%> <%enter%>”…It, looks like a demon. You can eat… something like that?” <%enter%> <%enter%>Illiana frowned upon seeing the grotesque looks of an octopus. Hari looked at her face and intervened.<%enter%> <%enter%>”What, you don’t know what an octopus is? It’s chewy and tastes good, you know.”<%enter%> <%enter%>As Hari finished talking, Yumi put the well-baked takoyaki into a bowl and handed it over to her.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Here’s your order. Bon appetit.”<%enter%> <%enter%>Upon receiving the takoyaki, Hari took a long wooden skewer and poked one ball. She cooled it down with her breath and took it into her mouth. And she chewed on it and savored the taste.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Hmm, not bad. But something is missing…”<%enter%>”What’s missing? I followed the recipe Thulhu taught me.”<%enter%> <%enter%>Seeing Yumi’s reaction, Hari took something out from her bag after a brief consideration.<%enter%> <%enter%>”It’s… honey! I think it'll taste even better with honey!” <%enter%> <%enter%>Hari poured a heaping amount of honey onto the takoyaki and took another ball into her mouth.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Just as I thought! Everything tastes best with honey on top!”<%enter%> <%enter%>Illiana, who was looking at Hari do this right next to her, spoke while looking at her with cold eyes.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Bread baked with a demonic beast in it… And you pour something on it that looks like it came out of Slimes…”<%enter%> <%enter%>Hari took offense at what Illiana said, so she poked a heavily-honeyed takoyaki ball and pushed it towards Illiana’s mouth.<%enter%>”Hmph! You won't be able to talk like that once you taste this!”<%enter%>”I refuse.”<%enter%> <%enter%>Thulhu the magic machine spoke after watching Hari and Illiana’s quarrel for a while.<%enter%> <%enter%>”It’s not a demonic beast, but an octopus. And the liquid is not melted Slime, but honey made by an insect species called bee.”<%enter%> <%enter%>After hearing Thulhu’s words, Illiana spoke again with a frown.<%enter%> <%enter%>”A liquid made by insects… I hate it even more.”<%enter%> <%enter%>Annoyed by Illiana’s reaction, Hari forcibly shoved a takoyaki ball into Illiana’s mouth.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Stop grumbling and just have a taste!”<%enter%>”Oof…!”<%enter%> <%enter%>Illiana tried to spit the takoyaki out, but Hari grabbed her from behind and covered her mouth with her big, bear-gloved hand. After some seconds, Illiana suddenly stopped struggling to escape from Hari. Hari released her and spoke.<%enter%> <%enter%>”See? It’s tasty, right?”<%enter%> <%enter%>Upon hearing Hari’s question, Illiana answered with a look that plainly showed that her pride had been hurt.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Not really… Salty, sweet, and tough.”<%enter%>”I shouldn't have shared it with you…”<%enter%> <%enter%>Disappointed that she got an answer utterly different from her expectation, Hari grumbled over the wasted takoyaki. However, Illiana said something unexpected.<%enter%> <%enter%>”One more.” <%enter%>”Huh? But you said it was salty, sweet, and tough.”<%enter%> <%enter%>As Illiana, who had only been spitting complaints, asked for one more takoyaki ball, Hari shot a skeptical look. Then, Illiana spoke with a confident look.<%enter%> <%enter%>""I’ll get rid of them for you by eating them.”<%enter%> <%enter%>Illiana’s shameless answer bewildered Hari.<%enter%> <%enter%>”No way!!!” <%enter%>”Are you refusing my generosity?” <%enter%> <%enter%>Hari and Illiana quarreled for quite a while after that. Yumi asked a question to Thulhu.<%enter%> <%enter%>”Thulhu, is this how land people really live?” <%enter%>”…Low on power. Switching to Standby mode.” <%enter%>”Thulhu?”<%enter%>"

ui_chapter_desc_1,"An unprecedented disaster happened in Ankara.<%enter%>People plunged into chaos in a blink, and the whole city got paralyzed. Males turned into monsters and started to attack people. And with the disappearance of males who were the majority of the military force, the army couldn't defend them. I recruited ""Joan"" and ""Noa,"" who I met while I was helping people as teammates, and we decided to defeat the monsters together."
ui_chapter_desc_2,"Following the dramatic victory in Ankara, we headed towards ""Molta,"" a small backwoods kingdom, in chase of the Demon King and his army. We couldn't fathom what the Demon King was trying to conspire in such a trifle kingdom that’s not even known by most ordinary people, but we set our destination to Molta off the bat to save as many people as we could."
ui_chapter_desc_3,"After fighting our way through the trap laid in the royal palace of Molta, we heard the news that the Demon King had lured us to Molta and captured more than half of areas of the “Western Union” in the meantime. If the Western Union, the majority of the population of which is male, is captured by the Demon King, his army will grow tremendously."
ui_chapter_desc_4,"We managed to stop the Demon King's army from capturing the Western Union entirely, but it seemed impossible to hold out anymore since their number had grown vastly. I decided to take few teammates with me and head for the Turon Empire to request reinforcements."
ui_chapter_desc_5,"After defeating the Polymorph, which had imprisoned the true queen of the Turon Empire and fooled all people pretending to be the princess, we joined forces with the reinforcements from the Empire and completely driven out the army of Demon King from the Western Union."
ui_chapter_desc_6,"While we were having a tough time against his army's fierce resistance, the Demon King stole the ""Mirror of Illusion,"" a treasure of the royal family of Aqua. He used it to show his beautiful new figure across the world and dazzled numerous males of various areas, ordering them to join his army. Unable to withstand the Demon King's rapidly increasing army anymore, we decided to retreat to Talia to regroup."
ui_chapter_desc_7,"After retreating to Talia, we started to search for a way to eliminate the Demon King's illusion to stop the expansion of his army. In the meantime, I met a famous magical artifactologist and learned the existence of the ""Mirror of Truth,"" the other pair of the ""Mirror of Illusion,"" and that by destroying it, the other mirror will also be destroyed. Chasing the trace of the ""Mirror of Truth,"" we headed towards Francisco, the last known place to have the mirror."
ui_chapter_desc_8,"We arrived at the Cathedral of Francisco after long search. However, the place was already laid waste by the Demon King's elite troops, and the mirror was long gone. Hearing from the people around the cathedral that the elite troops had headed to the border of Helvetia, we set off hurriedly towards Helvetia in pursuit."
ui_chapter_desc_9,"While we were fighting fiercely against the Demon King's elite troops for the Mirror of Truth, a group of bandits stole the mirror and took flight. We managed to defeat the troops and pursued the bandits, but they were long gone without any trace. Luckily, we were able to catch a drunken bandit who had been ditched by his friends, and from her we learned that the bandits were scheming to sell off the mirror at the black market in Vegas. We headed towards Vegas in haste."
ui_chapter_desc_10,"Having discovered the bandits surrounded by the Demon King's army at the black market in Vegas, we quickly mopped the troops up and captured them, but they had lost the Mirror of Truth already. The ringleader told us that they had handed the mirror over to the dealer who commissioned them to steal the mirror and left for Alchedonia. We hurriedly headed to Alchedonia, the would-be destination of the dealer. "
ui_chapter_desc_11,"In Alchedonia, we discovered the dealer, who was about to be killed by the elite monsters of the Demon King's army, and managed to rescue her. She revealed that she was actually the mother superior of the Central Abbey of Cavithan and persuaded us that we have to use the Mirror of Truth to disclose the Demon King’s true form hidden by those fake beautiful figure. We were suspicious of her but headed to Transylvania, the place known as where the Goddess' was abiding now, to confirm the truth."
ui_chapter_desc_12,"After defeating the Demon King's underlings tenaciously trying to stop us, we managed to arrive at the royal palace of Transylvania and met the Goddess. She confirmed that the mother superior's words were true and demanded us to hand the Mirror of Truth over to her so that she can reveal the Demon King's true form. We gave it to her as she wanted, and she asked us to escort her, saying that she need to head for the Temple of Goddess hidden in Antaria Mountains to draw the power of the mirror. We gladly accepted the request and set off towards Antaria with the Goddess."
ui_chapter_desc_13,"After arriving at the Temple of Goddess past a deep cave in the Antaria Mountains, we waited for the Goddess to finish her ceremony while guarding the temple's entrance. Near the end of the ceremony, there was a huge explosion in the temple and the entrance collapsed in a blink. The aftermath started to collapse the cave's several entrances one by one, and we began to run for our lives, following a path that wasn't blocked yet. It was days after we started to walk the path of endless darkness that we saw the sun again. We could see that we were now in the land of Barbaria."
ui_chapter_desc_14,"While fighting the Demon King's army that invaded Barbaria without even knowing whether the Goddess was alive, we heard the news that the Demon King's illusions across the world had disappeared. Thinking that the Goddess had sacrificed herself to finish the ceremony successfully, we boarded on a ship at a port in Barbaria and departed to the domain of old Ethos, known as the base of the Demon King's army. However, the ship started to sink due to a huge storm that stroke us just one day after departure, so we changed the course to the nearest shore of Dragonia, a place called the ""Isle of Dragons."""
ui_chapter_desc_15,"While struggling to repair our ship in the now deserted Dragonia and preparing to set sail again, we accidentally discovered a suspicious crystal ball, left in the seawater near the old Draconian port. As we touched the crystal ball, a voice came out from it. It said to us that a massive army of the Demon King had landed at Dragonia and was trying to surround us. It also told us that it had opened a dimensional gate, which had been used by Draconians in the past, in the middle of Dragonia and we must use that portal to escape before we can be surrounded. We barely managed to break through the Demon King’s army and arrived at the dimensional gate. Their fierce attack forced us to throw ourselves into the gate, without even thinking about what would happen next. The shock of passing through a dimensional gate knocked us all unconscious. When we woke up, we were on a sandy beach. It didn't take us long to realize that we were in the small remote kingdom of Ios."
ui_chapter_desc_16,"After taking a break at the sandy beach of Ios, we headed to the royal palace of Ios to replenish our rations, which were running short. As we arrived at the palace’s front gate, we realized from the screaming that a battle being waged inside. Entering the palace in a hurry, we couldn't help but be surprised who we saw fighting the monsters. They looked exactly the same as us. Unlike Polymorph, a monster that copies princesses, each of them had their own ego and were helping and talking to each other to win the battle. After defeating the monsters, they noticed us looking at them in confusion and spoke with an icy look.<%enter%>”Those faces… You lot don't know, do you? What the Goddess did… Go to Underdome. The answer to all this lies there. You wouldn't believe us if we told you…”<%enter%>They left as soon as they said that, and we immediately headed towards Underdome to find out what they wanted us to learn."
ui_chapter_desc_17,"We arrived at the underground kingdom of Underdome after defeating hordes of monsters. We met “Telavin,” a Dark Elf sorcerer, and explained to her what had happened at Ios. She told us that the Goddess had cast forbidden dark magic using the “Mirror of Truth” at the hidden temple in Antaria, and this caused several exact copies of princesses to exist for some reason. She mocked the Goddess, saying that she had taken extreme measures because she had been cornered by the Demon King. Then, she told us to take responsibility and resolve everything that happened since we were the ones who gave the Goddess the Mirror of Truth and took her to Antaria.<%enter%>We were all stupefied by her shocking words and asked her for a solution. She then approached me and whispered the secret of the magic cast upon the princesses into my ear. Then, she told me to go to “Amazones,” a kingdom located deep in the jungle, saying that everything would be determined by my decision. After some long thought, I decided to follow her words and set off towards Amazones."
ui_chapter_desc_18,"Arriving at Amazones, we got ambushed by the Demon King’s army while wandering the labyrynthian jungle. We were nearly wiped out by their forces. The princesses fell one by one, but right at the moment before I was about to collapse, the warriors of Amazones appeared. They defeated the Demon King’s army and guided us to their royal palace.<%enter%>As soon as we arrived at the palace, without pause, I entered the Temple of Goddess and confided the secret that “Telavin” told me to the princesses: we can become much stronger if we perform the “Ceremony of Souls” she mentioned here in the Temple of Goddess, but we’d need to make a sacrifice.<%enter%>Terrified by the memory of nearly getting annihilated, the princesses urged me to perform the ceremony, but I confessed that the ceremony involved merging the souls, and the ones who’d be sacrificed may not return to their old selves. The aim of the forbidden spell used by the Goddess was to summon the princesses of a parallel world into our world using the Mirror of Truth. In this way, the princesses of this world could get powerful enough to fight the Demon King’s army through the Ceremony of Souls. The princesses fell silent after I finished speaking. I opened the temple door and told them that those who wanted to leave may leave. Nobody left. I closed the temple door and started the Ceremony of Souls while repressing my grief.<%enter%><%enter%>The next day, we left towards “Ethos,” the place where fierce battles are taking place against the Demon King’s army, with grim determination."
ui_chapter_desc_19,"After a short journey, we arrived at Ethos and faced the ruins of a kingdom where destroyed by the devil a long time ago. By the time we thought that the world would be destroyed without people who sacrificed themselves, we could hear the sound of an army of Demon and other princesses fighting in the distance. We went into battle without delay and helped the princess and led to victory from annihilation. They lost their leader and agreed to join us.<%enter%> Several times after that, the fierce battle continued and eventually wipe out all the Demons from Ethos. But the joy of victory was not for long. We heard the story that ""The Great Wall"" had fallen again to Demon from a  Kavitan's messenger. <%enter%>Feint Operation...<%enter%>Was it the bait from the start?<%enter%>If the Great Wall fell, Cavitan would be a lamp in front of the wind. We hurriedly prepared a long journey to the Great Wall."
ui_chapter_desc_20,"We arrived at the “Great Wall” after a long and arduous journey, and the place looked horrible.<%enter%>The giant rampart, which was the symbol of the Great Wall, was collapsed everywhere. The miserable state it was in showed just how relentless the attack by the Demon King’s army was. At least they didn’t break through the Cavithan gate, thanks to the Cavithan Paladins’ fierce resistance. However, if the army that had destroyed the Great Wall came with reinforcements, the gate would be destroyed in no time.<%enter%>We hurriedly dropped anchor and headed towards the center of the Great Wall to stop the enemy forces from reaching Cavithan. Whenever we ran into the Demon King’s troops heading to Cavithan, we fought with all our might and made them retreat.<%enter%>A few days later, when we felt assured that the enemy must have given up, we heard news of more reinforcements marching towards Romanetia. It seemed they were aiming to go through Romanetia and attack Cavithan from the behind. That would clearly be a huge threat to Cavithan. We set our course to Romanetia and left in a hurry to stop them."
ui_chapter_desc_21,"The Demon King’s army made a surprise attack on Romanetia, and the citizens had no choice but to run away. When we arrived, the army already occupied the former royal palace.<%enter%>However, the citizens of Romanetia, who had been turned undead as punishment for betraying the Goddess a long time ago, began to launch fierce counterattacks all across the nation in the earnest hope of clearing the karma of their ancestors and lifting the curse.<%enter%>We launched a major offensive with the citizens to drive the Demon King's army away from Romanetia, and the army couldn't do anything but retreat. Eventually, the Demon King’s army deserted the former royal palace and fled to Old Romanetia, a land that is now uninhabitable. We decided to pursue them to deliver the final blow and stop them from ever causing trouble again."

story_1-6,"We were able to save many people after managing to defeat Polymorph.

We started to run towards the abbey in a hurry."

story_1-12,"As we reached the gate, we saw that the battle nuns of the Order of the Goddess fighting fiercely against numerous monsters. The gate looked like it was about to collapse at any moment, so we had no time to waste. We decided to ambush the leader of those monsters and rushed to the battleground."

unit_story_Redeye,"One of the six princesses of ""Transylvania,"" the kingdom of Vampires famous for its gloomy sky. Peculiarly enough, she is a Half Vampire born from Vampire and Human parents. She didn't get treated very well in the kingdom due to not being a pure vampire, so the king pities her and sends her out of the country often by making her as a diplomatic envoy."
unit_story_Plumehat,"The daughter of ""Great Witch Ancacella,"" the head of the witches' council, ""Dark Moon."" Unlike her mother who rules those well known for their magic, she is famous for her gluttony rather than magical prowess. She loves to roast marshmallows by campfire, making her face red all the time because of the heat."
unit_story_Brownpony,"Born in ""Manimaland,"" the union country of several Human and Demihuman tribes, she is the Grand Chief's only daughter. Her family has been of Druidic pedigree for generations, but she chose to become a priestess. She is famous for wandering the world and taking care of sick people and animals and never ignores the sick."
unit_story_Carrot,"The princess of the ""Turon Empire,"" a country ruled by the empress. Despite not being the daughter of the emperor and quite behind in line of succession, she was beloved by the empress. This incurred the hatred of her older sisters, who sent assassins after her. Having been threatened by assassins too many times, now she even assassinates the assassins and is walking their path to becoming one."
unit_story_Skyblue,"The princess of ""Helvetia,"" a neutral kingdom famous for its commerce. She joined the army to fulfill the duty of royal blood. Even though her mandatory period of service is finished, she refused to return to the royal palace and joined a private military company. Rumor has it that she is actually a warmonger despite her calm appearance, but she claims that rumor is false."
unit_story_Goldshield,"The princess of ""Malta,"" a small kingdom located in a remote area. Despite the king's dissent, she joined the ""Great Wall,"" the united defense troops fighting against the Demon King's army, to prosper her kingdom. She even served as the company commander of the Iron Wall squadron which is said to be the best among the troops. Since she was born and raised in the countryside, she is naive and knows little about the world."
unit_story_Monk,"The princess as well as a Battle Monk of the Order of the Goddess, of the Kingdom of ""Ankara,"" the country where the biggest abbey in the world is located. The Battle Monks were born to protect the abbey against evil forces, and by following its regulation to not use any weapon in battle, they only use their own bare hands and bodies to fight. An overly kind person, she even feels sorry for the monsters she kills."
unit_story_Redhood,"Joan's older sister and the second among six princesses of ""Transylvania,"" the kingdom of Vampires. As a pureblood Vampire, she has tremendous power. However, since she is severely mysophobic, she only uses bow or magic in combat so that blood won’t splatter on her. She even uses a straw every time she drinks blood."
unit_story_Highelf,"The princess of ""Saviour,"" the kingdom of High Elves whose history is the longest among all races in the world. Rumors say she is more than 3,000 years old and has been a princess for over 2 millennia. Her appearance looks young since Elves don't get old, but her preferences are like an old lady’s. She doesn't like her food too sweet or too spicy."
unit_story_Bullygirl,"The princess of the Western Union. Since the country is located in barren land without any proper resource, 90% of its people work as mercenaries in wars between other countries or battles against the Demon King's army. Therefore, the country is practically a giant mercenary union. This kind of environment gave the princess a spiteful tongue and she grew up more ignorant than any backstreet miscreant, so she is called the Hooligan Princess in nearby countries."
unit_story_Blacksmith,"The daughter of the Guildmaster of the ""Great Anvil,"" the union of blacksmiths. It is a taboo for blacksmiths to participate in battles directly. However, as the miners, who provide iron ores necessary to them, were killed by the Demon King, she declared the end of the taboo and joined in the war against the Demon King. Her hobby is to nag her teammates who are careless with their equipment."
unit_story_Pirate,"The princess of ""El Dorado,"" the allied country of pirates that rules over the western sea. As a hot-blooded princess who always says ""finding hidden treasures is the ultimate ambition of a pirate,"" she came to the mainland as soon as she heard the rumor that the Demon King was hiding a tremendous amount of treasures. Though, she gets nauseous whenever she rides a carriage."
unit_story_Gambler,"The princess of ""Vegas,"" the kingdom of gambling. As the kingdom is faced with a threat of bankruptcy since all rich men, the main customers of the kingdom's casino, left their country following the Demon King, she joined the war against him to recover her country's finances. She is good at detecting various tricks and traps, thanks to her experience in spotting cheaters. She's also skilled in taunting or driving enemies into chaos with words."
unit_story_Baba,"The princess of ""Barbaria,"" a nomadic tribal nation. She joined the war against the Demon King since he took the men needed for looking after horses and sheep. She doesn't talk much and usually prefers to listen to others' opinions, but speaks firmly if it is about meals. She detests having any meal without any meat."
unit_story_Crusader,"The last royal descent of ""Ethos,"" a kingdom fell under the Demon King's army. As her kingdom was destroyed while she was working for the ""Great Wall,"" the union defense troops against the Demon King, she deserted them and founded the ""Crimson Crusaders"" for vengeance. She tends to overreact to everything related to the Demon King."
unit_story_Jungle,"The princess of ""Amazones,"" a country located deep inside the jungle at the continent's southernmost part and ruled by a Queen. As all men in the Amazones disappeared because of the recent Demon King incident, she emerged from the jungle to defeat the Demon King and retrieve the men he took. Since men are expected to do housework in Amazones, her home looks like a total disaster area."
unit_story_Ladydeath,"The princess of ""Romanetia,"" the kingdom of Undeads. A long time ago, Romanetia was the strongest Human kingdom, but they chose to side with the Demon King. After losing the war, the Demon King was sealed, and Romanetia received a curse that turned the whole kingdom into the land of Undeads. She joined this war to remedy her ancestors' choice and lift the curse with honor. She uses perfume often but can't smell it."
unit_story_Darkelf,"The princess of ""Underdome,"" the kingdom of Dark Elves whose history can be compared to that of High Elves. She is often misunderstood as an underling of the Demon King because of her evil-looking appearance, but she had never worked under him. However, her atrocious magic makes people think that the Dark Elves are more evil than Demons."
unit_story_Nun,"The third princess of ""Cavithan,"" a theocratic country ruled by the pope. She is a stepdaughter of the pope as well as an Exorcist Nun of the Central Abbey. With the rapid decline in the number of believers, she received an oracle from the Goddess and joined the war against the Demon King. She is a master with rifles that can fire divine power instead of bullets and likes to preach to her teammates."
unit_story_Ice,"The princess of ""Shyberia,"" the ice kingdom located far north. Originally, she came as an envoy for trading ice with Romanetia, but got marooned since all the ships disappeared following the outbreak of the Demon King Incident. Although she looks innocent, she is a heavy drinker who loves strong liquor and tends to fire magic recklessly to burn the calories gained from drinking."
unit_story_Cook,"The first princess of ""Talia,"" a country famous for its delicious cuisine. As she is crazy about cooking, her interest is in the indigenous products growing in the regions under the Demon King’s rule, rather than defeating him. She likes to cook with ingredients she’s never seen before and test its taste on her teammates."
unit_story_Fiance,"A would-be princess who was engaged to the prince of ""Francisco,"" a wealthy kingdom. She was looking forward to marrying the young prince, but when the Demon King Incident broke out, he left her and followed the Demon King. Enraged, she founded an army and declared that she would defeat the Demon King. She is a former Head Knight of Royal Knights of Francisco and a self-made person, but quite insecure about her age."
unit_story_Alchemy,"The princess of ""Alchedonia,"" a kingdom famous for alchemy. Being one of the countries that earn the most money following the outbreak of war, the kingdom dispatched the princess as soon as the Demon King incident broke out in order to promote their recently invented potions. She tends to overuse potions in battle, which sometimes leads to weird side effects after the battle."
unit_story_Rabbit,"The rabbit princess of ""Foresto,"" the country of Demihumans which rules over the vast forest in the east. Despite her tiny and cute figure, she is very skilled in martial arts. A bit unfriendly, she thinks her big ears are weak points for a martial artist, but every time someone says they’re cute, she can't really stop from smiling. Her emotions are usually written all over her face."
unit_story_Swordcat,"The cat princess hail from ""Nippon,"" an island of Demihumans located on the far eastern sea. She left her homeland by accident when she snuck into a ship from another country out of curiosity and fell asleep. She frequently thinks she should go back to her country but quickly forgets about it whenever she sees something that makes her curious again."
unit_story_Flower,"The princess of ""Netherland,"" a union of Human and Demihuman which is famous for flowers. A Half-Elf born from High Elf king and Human queen, her father is known as a member of the Heroes who defeated the Demon King a long time ago. Just like her father, she is conversant with natural healing magic which uses flowers. However, she has a severe complex about her father's womanizing nature."
unit_story_Middle,"The princess of ""Luxor,"" the richest kingdom in the world located in the eastern desert. Even though the country is in the middle of a vast and empty desert, they raked in a tremendous amount of wealth with the ""Mana Oil"" gushing out from the ground. Many poor countries' princes courted her, and she’s had 3 divorces since those men were only after her wealth. Some might say her looks deserve a fair part of the blame…"
unit_story_Bdragon,"One of the three princesses of ""Dragonia,"" the lost kingdom of Dragons. Nothing is known about her except that she is very old. As the only remaining Draconian man disappeared due to the Demon King incident, all three sisters joined the war to get him back. She is the most docile among the sisters, and she knits for fun."
unit_story_Queen,"The queen of ""Antaria,"" a kingdom consists of rough mountains. After losing her husband in a battle against the Demon King's army, and even her treasured son disappearing due to the recent Demon King incident, she joined the war to retrieve her son. Before becoming a queen, she served as a commander of the Great Wall and was a famous gladiator. "
unit_story_Gdragon,"One of the three princesses of ""Dragonia,"" the lost kingdom of Dragons. Nothing is known about her except that she is very old. As the only remaining Draconian man disappeared due to the Demon King incident, all three sisters joined the war to get him back. Unlike ordinary Draconians, she is shy and apt to cry, but she is the last person anyone would want to meet between three princesses when she is mad."
unit_story_Redhead,"She is the descendant of the red-haired Hero, who defeated the Demon King a long time ago, as well as the princess of ""Ios,"" a small kingdom located in a remote region. Red hair is her family's hereditary feature, and all males of her family line were womanizers and born with itchy feet, which led to complex family relations. Perhaps because of the instincts in her bloodline, she left her hometown and started traveling as soon as she came of age. "
unit_story_Dualcross,"The second princess of ""Cavithan,"" a theocratic country ruled by the pope. Like her little sister Maria, she is a stepdaughter of the pope as well as an Exorcist Nun of the Central Abbey. Unlike her little sister, she seems to be assigned with a secret mission regarding the pope who disappeared in secret by the Goddess, aside from the mission known to the public."
unit_story_Ass,"""Sicaria,"" a big port city located in the middle of the continent, was once the capital of the great empire of Romanetia.

unit_story_Priest,"The fourth princess of ""Cavithan,"" a theocratic country ruled by the pope. She is a stepdaughter of the pope like her older sisters, but she chose to be a priestess instead of a nun. Currently, she is serving as a High Priestess of the Faithful of the Goddess. She is diligent and ethical as a priestess should be, but recently she's been pressing her teammates to donate money to the church. Her church might have a financial problem lately."
